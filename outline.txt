# Presentation ideas for talk

- mention git , why it is important (PhD comics strip). Quick working example.

- Bash is your friend. Code example (sample analysis?) and pathological examples (joinsort)

- recycle code (e.g. commons library in FG)

- test cases. mention it can be hard at times

- cache your data

- documentation (cfr git)

- naive parallelization when you can
